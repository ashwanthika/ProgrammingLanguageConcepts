This project involves the implementation of a calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix notation. The project consists of two main parts: one for evaluating RPN expressions directly and the other for converting algebraic infix expressions to RPN and then evaluating them.
2. Folder named:axu4976_lab01
The aim of the provided C,java,python code is to calculate and display the total size of files and subdirectories within a given directory. It does this by recursively traversing the directory structure, summing up the sizes of files and directories encountered.

This Python program generates mazes using recursive backtracking and displays them visually using ASCII characters. Users input the maze dimensions, and the program then creates and prints the maze's layout.
4. Folder named:lab02
This JavaScript code demonstrates various functional programming concepts through a series of tasks. The program starts by creating an array of numbers from 1 to 10. It then performs operations such as calculating multiples, squares, and sums of certain numbers based on defined conditions. Currying is utilized to rewrite a cylinder volume calculation function, and closures are employed to create HTML tags for table structure. Lastly, the code implements a generic version of computing odd and even multiples of given numbers within a range. Each part is well-commented and executed, showcasing functional programming techniques and their application to different tasks.
